# Fire Rating Implementation Summary

All items in the fire rating implementation checklist have been completed. The key improvements made were:

1. **Fixed Export and Structure**: Properly exported the `getFixedWidthForFireRating` function from `timberEngineering.js` and consolidated duplicate implementations.

2. **Corrected Data Flow**: Made sure the fire rating is processed early in the calculation pipeline, setting minimum member widths and influencing concrete thickness which adds to the dead load.

3. **Removed SL33 Dependency**: Updated the `FireResistanceCalculator` component to use ML38 data instead of the non-existent `loadMasslamSL33CharringRate` function.

4. **Self-Weight Feedback**: Verified and enhanced the self-weight feedback loop in the calculation functions, ensuring that member weights are added to the loads and recalculated.

5. **Context Improvements**: Enhanced the `BuildingDataContext` with a specialized handler for fire rating changes to ensure concrete thickness is automatically updated when fire rating changes.

6. **Error Handling**: Added validation for fire rating inputs and provided fallbacks for invalid values.

7. **Testing and Debugging**: Added strategic console logs to validate the fire rating flow and confirm proper behavior.

The Fire Rating Level now properly influences the structural calculations as intended:
- Sets minimum member widths based on fire resistance requirements
- Determines concrete thickness which adds to the dead load
- Ensures self-weight is properly calculated and fed back
- Updates all related values when fire rating changes

These improvements ensure that the Timber Calculator correctly accounts for fire resistance requirements in its structural design calculations.
